# [BitcoinCashFlow](https://github.com/BitcoinDB/BitcoinCashFlow): The simple, safe, reliable and powerful JavaScript library for Bitcoin Cash

## About BitcoinCashFlow

BitcoinCashFlow is a community driven effort to produce a readable, reliable and modern Javascript implementation of Bitcoin. Most current Javascript Bitcoin implementations do not adhere to modern coding standards and are very hard to read as a consequence. We want to create a Bitcoin implementation that every JavaScript programmer can read and understand.

In step one, we want to get the entire codebase to comply with the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Step two will be to statically typecheck the entire codebase with Facebookâ€™s Flow.

We are looking for contributors. You do not have to be a Bitcoin protocol expert to contribute. All you need to be is a good Javascript programmer. If you want to help, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md] or email [clemens@bitcointoken.com](mailto:clemens@bitcointoken.com).

## Warning

BitcoinCashFlow is currently undergoing a major refactoring which might break parts of the API. **We do not recommed it to be used until the version 1.0.0 is released.**

## About Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, has no central bank, and requires no trusted third-parties to operate. Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project, upgraded with consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale.
